# NotesOverlay

This is a GDI overlay for presentation notes. You can cycle through notes and it won't show in most screenshares. Please note that this might not be allowed for use in some school presentations. 

## Usage 

Make a text file somewhere and put the notes in it. Separate lines with line breaks, and separate chunks with a line in between. 

Example: 

```
This is a line of text
This is another line that will be shown with the above line 

This is a line that will be shown by itself 

This is part of a big chunk of text 
This is another part of the same big chunk of text
These are clumped together so they will be shown together
```

Run the program, select the file, and press the cycle key (numpad2 by default) to cycle through chunks of text.
